 ## What is it?
The Scran Plan cooking application aims to help users batch cook meals on a budget. The user can select and collate recipes that they plan to cook for that week and create an in app shopping list that is constructed from the ingredients that the user specified they do not own. With the added ability of creating a personalised profile, the user will be able to tailor the application to their tastes so that they can filter out any of the recipes that don’t suit, save their favourite recipes and share them with their friends.
